    # Environments the tool is active in. It is never active anywhere else, so a
    # production deploy can't accidentally expose the key markers or the endpoint.
    attr_accessor :enabled_environments

    # Per-request gate, on top of the environment check. Return false to hide the
    # tool for this request. Receives the Rack::Request. Plug in an admin check, a
    # feature flag, an allowlist, etc.
    attr_accessor :enabled

    # Per-request gate for the triage dashboard (browse suggestions, change their
    # status, delete). Independent of `enabled` and `enabled_environments`: the
    # widget is dev/staging-only, but a maintainer may want to triage from
    # production. Defaults to development only, so a fresh install never exposes
    # the dashboard until you wire it to your own admin check.

    # Layout used by the triage dashboard. Override this to render it inside
    # your app's admin shell, e.g. "admin/application".

    # Resolve the current user for attribution (optional). Return an object
    # responding to #id, or nil. Receives the Rack::Request.
    attr_accessor :current_user

    # Turn a resolved user into a short label shown in the "already suggested"
    # list. Receives whatever #current_user returned.

    # The locales a suggestion may target. Used to validate submissions.

    # "#{mount_path}/suggestions", so keep this in sync with the `mount` line in

    # from your own link instead (see #toggle_param).

    # ("Suggest edits", translated via the `i18n_proofreading.pill` I18n key).

    # The query-string parameter that turns suggest mode on/off, so a host can
    # link to it from anywhere: "?i18n_proofreading=true" enables it, "false" exits.

    # suggest mode without the parameter.

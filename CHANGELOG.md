# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0]

- **Renamed the gem `i18n_feedback` → `i18n_proofreading`.** The name now says
  what it does. This renames everything: the gem, the `I18nProofreading` module,
  the `i18n_proofreading.*` locale scope, the suggest-mode cookie / toggle
  parameter (`i18n_proofreading`), the default mount path (`/i18n_proofreading`),
  and the DB table (`i18n_proofreading_suggestions`).

  **Migrating from `i18n_feedback`:** point your `Gemfile` at `i18n_proofreading`,
  rename the initializer, and rename the table + any references:

  ```ruby
  # a migration
  rename_table :i18n_feedback_suggestions, :i18n_proofreading_suggestions
  ```

  Then update `I18nFeedback` → `I18nProofreading`, the `config/initializers`
  file, the `mount` line, any `t("i18n_feedback.*")` you added, and the
  `?i18n_feedback=` toggle links to their `i18n_proofreading` equivalents.

- **Switched the test suite from RSpec to Minitest** (`test/`, `bin/rails test`
  / `rake test`). No behavior change; internal only.

## [0.8.2]

- Fix the dashboard's locale filter doing nothing under a strict (nonce-based)
  Content-Security-Policy: it relied on an inline `onchange` handler, which such
  a CSP blocks. The filter now has an always-visible **Filter** submit button, so
  it works with JS off or inline handlers blocked (the `onchange` stays as a
  nicety where allowed).
- Give the locale filter a visible **Locale** label.

## [0.8.1]

- Make the dashboard **read-only**. Apply / Reject / Reopen / Delete only ever
  flipped the stored `status` — they never touched the host's locale files, so
  offering them implied a capability the gem doesn't have. The buttons and their
  `update` / `destroy` routes and actions are removed; the dashboard now just
  lists suggestions for review, and you make the edits in your own locale files.
  A suggestion's `status` still exists on the model for out-of-band tracking and
  as groundwork for a future "apply to locale file" feature.

## [0.8.0]

- Add a built-in **triage dashboard**, mounted at the engine root (your
  `mount_path`, default `/i18n_proofreading`): pending / applied / rejected tabs
  with counts, a per-locale filter, each suggestion shown current-vs-proposed,
  and one-click Apply / Reject / Reopen / Delete. Plain server-rendered HTML
  with its own self-contained styling (light + dark via `prefers-color-scheme`)
  — no host assets or JS framework required.
- Every dashboard string renders through Rails I18n under `i18n_proofreading.dashboard.*`
  and `i18n_proofreading.statuses.*`, with English fallbacks, so a host can translate
  or reword any of it from its own locale files.
- Add `config.authorize_admin` — the dashboard's gate, **defaulting to
  development only** so a fresh install never exposes it in production. It is
  independent of `enabled` / `enabled_environments`, so a maintainer can triage
  from production even where the widget is off.
- The widget's "already suggested" context now loads from
  `GET {mount_path}/suggestions/context` (was the collection index, now the
  dashboard). Internal to the gem; the bundled widget was updated in lockstep.

## [0.7.1]

- The `i18n_proofreading.stop` toggle label now reads "Stop suggesting (Esc)" in
  every language — Esc already exits suggest mode, so the control says so.
- The widget JavaScript moved from `app/assets/` to `lib/` (it was always
  inlined server-side, never served as an asset). Rails auto-registers every
  engine's `app/assets/*` directory with the host's asset pipeline, so
  Propshaft hosts were ingesting the file into their asset namespace under
  the bare logical name `widget.js` — colliding with any other gem or host
  file of the same name — and needlessly digesting a public copy at
  precompile. The gem is now invisible to Sprockets/Propshaft entirely.
  No behavior change.

## [0.7.0]

- Reword the `i18n_proofreading.start` toggle label from "Suggest edits" to
  "Improve translation" (localized in every language) — clearer for a menu/link
  entry. The floating pill's own label (`pill`) is unchanged.
- Ship 5 more languages: Bulgarian, Greek, Croatian, Luxembourgish, and
  Romanian — 25 languages besides English now bundled.

## [0.6.1]

- Shorten the active-pill label from "Suggesting — tap to exit (Esc)" to
  "Stop suggesting (Esc)" across all bundled languages.
- Release workflow: skip the flaky post-publish propagation probe
  (`await-release: false`) so a successful push no longer fails the job.

## [0.6.0]

- Ship `i18n_proofreading.start` / `i18n_proofreading.stop` labels in every bundled
  language, for hosts that drive suggest mode from their own menu/link instead
  of the floating pill. Because the `i18n_proofreading.*` scope is exempt from
  key-marking, these are safe to render with `t(...)` — no plain-literal
  workaround needed. See the "Toggling suggest mode from your own link" README
  section for a full HTML example.

## [0.5.0]

- Add a `status` to each suggestion — a string-backed Active Record enum with
  values `pending`, `applied`, and `rejected` (`I18nProofreading::Suggestion::STATUSES`),
  `status_`-prefixed (`status_applied?`, `status_applied!`, `Suggestion.status_pending`)
  plus a `newest_first` scope. New suggestions start `pending`; the popover's
  "already suggested" context now shows only pending ones, so applied/rejected
  wordings stop resurfacing.

  **Upgrading an existing install:** add the column with a migration —

  ```ruby
  add_column :i18n_proofreading_suggestions, :status, :string, null: false, default: "pending"
  add_index  :i18n_proofreading_suggestions, :status
  ```

- Harden the public submission endpoint against abuse:
  - Per-IP rate limiting via Rails' built-in limiter (Rails 7.2+; a no-op on
    7.1). Default 30 requests / 60s, tunable or disable-able via
    `config.rate_limit`; returns `429 Too Many Requests`.
  - Length caps on the stored free-text fields (`proposed_value` / `old_value`
    5000, `comment` / `page_url` 2000, `translation_key` 500) so a client can't
    bloat the table with unbounded input.

- Add a `.github/workflows/release.yml` that publishes to RubyGems via trusted
  publishing (OIDC) when a `v*` tag is pushed — no stored credentials or MFA
  prompt.

## [0.4.0]

- Add a `config.on_submit` hook, called with each saved suggestion right after
  it's stored — notify Slack, send an email, open a ticket. Runs inline after
  save, so keep it fast or hand off to a job.

## [0.3.1]

- Fix the widget showing raw key markers (e.g. `⟦i18n_proofreading.title⟧`) in its own
  popover while suggest mode was on. The key-marking backend was tagging the
  tool's own `i18n_proofreading.*` strings; those are not part of the host app's
  translatable copy, so they're now always skipped — the widget never marks or
  offers to edit its own UI.
- Fix the popover not following the page's language under auto-injection. The
  widget is injected in middleware *after* the controller action, so an
  `around_action { I18n.with_locale(...) }` had already reset `I18n.locale` back
  to the default — the popover (and the saved suggestion's `locale`) came out in
  the wrong language. The locale is now read from the page's rendered
  `<html lang>` attribute and labels resolve under it explicitly.

## [0.3.0]

- Localize the widget's own UI. Every string in the pill and the suggestion
  popover now resolves through Rails I18n under the `i18n_proofreading.*` scope and
  follows the app's current `I18n.locale`, so the tool speaks the same language as
  the app being proofread. Any key a host hasn't translated falls back to English
  — so nothing goes blank in a locale you haven't fully covered. Override any
  string by defining the matching key in your own locale files.
- Ship translations out of the box for 20 languages in addition to English:
  Arabic, Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian,
  Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish,
  Ukrainian, Urdu and Vietnamese.
- Render the popover right-to-left for RTL locales (Arabic, Urdu, and other RTL
  scripts), detected from the active locale's language subtag. The i18n key stays
  left-to-right, since it's a code identifier rather than prose.
- `config.pill_label` now defaults to `nil`, meaning "use the localized default".
  Setting it to a string still overrides the pill text as before.
- The widget now follows the operating system's light/dark/system appearance via
  `prefers-color-scheme`. The pill and popover render with a dark surface when the
  reviewer's system is in dark mode, with no configuration required.

## [0.2.2]

- Fix suggest mode desyncing under a nonce-based CSP on Turbo visits. The runtime
  config now rides in a `<script type="application/json">` block (data, not code)
  that the widget re-reads on every `turbo:load`, instead of an executable
  `<script>` the browser refuses to re-run when Turbo re-evaluates it with a stale
  nonce. Only the widget code carries the CSP nonce now.
- Treat `?i18n_proofreading=true|false` as a one-shot command: the middleware sets the
  cookie and redirects (303) to the same URL without the parameter. The cookie is
  now the single source of truth, so the parameter no longer sticks in the address
  bar and the pill's reload can turn suggest mode off.
- Let a host's own toggle link work while suggest mode is active. Suggest mode
  freezes navigation so a stray click can't leave the page mid-proofread, but that
  also froze a `?i18n_proofreading=false` link in your own nav — so the only way out
  was the pill. Links carrying the toggle parameter are now exempt from the freeze.

## [0.2.1]

- Keep the suggest pill and active-mode highlighting working across Turbo Drive
  navigations. Turbo replaces `<body>` on each visit, which removed the pill; the
  widget now re-runs its per-page setup on `turbo:load` instead of only on the
  initial load, so it no longer requires a hard reload.

## [0.2.0]

- Stamp the injected widget scripts with the request's Content-Security-Policy
  nonce when one is present, so the tool works under a nonce-based CSP (including
  `strict-dynamic`). No-op for apps without a CSP nonce.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release.
- In-context i18n key markers, gated to configured environments and toggled per
  request by the widget.
- Self-contained browser widget (no CSS or JS framework required) with a suggest
  pill and a per-string suggestion popover. The copy cursor and hover outline
  appear only on the strings that resolve to a key.
- Optional floating pill (`config.show_pill`) and a URL toggle
  (`?i18n_proofreading=true` / `false`, remembered in a cookie) so suggest mode can
  be triggered from a host-provided link instead.
- `I18nProofreading::Suggestion` model and mountable engine endpoints for listing and
  creating suggestions.
- `i18n_proofreading:install` generator (initializer, migration, engine mount).
